# encode-and-decode
Build with Python.
This can turn text into a string that anyone __don't know__(expect you)!
After *encoding* Jason123 ,it will *return* @#$[)Abc.
After *decoding* the word you encode, it will *return* the word you use it to encode.
**WARNING:** Since this is a WIP,this **ONLY** works on Jason123.
